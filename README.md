# Portfolio Site

I want my portfolio site to be clear, easy to navigate, and easy to read, but also fun (inasmuch as a portfolio site can be fun). To achieve this, I've stayed away from distracting (and not always well-supported) animations and focused instead on striking color combinations with accents of unusual lines and shapes.

Another main focus of this project is mobile responsiveness - I want to make sure that the site looks good on as many devices as possible. I developed the site using React (Hooks), and I use the Material-UI library extensively as a foundation for my components. While MUI components come with some mobile responsiveness out of the box, I have heavily customized most of the components I used to make sure they behave exactly as I want them to at each screen width. In fact, I added an additional xxs screen-width breakpoint to be sure the site looks good on very narrow screens.

While my site does not follow every Material Design maxim, I think I've struck a balance between taking advantage of well-designed components in some cases (links drawer at narrow screen widths, success snackbar after submitting a message) while customizing components everywhere else.
